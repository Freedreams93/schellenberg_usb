"""Live calibration-drive flow shared by pairing and reconfigure.

CalibrationFlowHandler below drives one blind/shutter through an actual
open-and-close calibration run: the person picks which direction to
calibrate first, each leg then waits for the real movement-start/stop
telegrams that leg produces (not a fixed delay), and a hub-wide status-
frame capture runs alongside to find which device ID/enum combination
that blind is actually sending its position telegrams as. Both the
fresh-pairing subentry flow and the reconfigure subentry flow
(config_flow.py) delegate to the same handler instance for this - a
fresh pairing turns the result into a brand-new subentry, a
recalibration updates the existing one instead; see
enable_subentry_creation()/disable_subentry_creation() for how each
flow selects its own route, and async_step_calibration_complete() for
where that split actually happens.
